     * This field of altPermissions is strictly for displaying helpful information to the end users
     * and it is only helpful if it is included.
     * 
     * For example the command /rankup has an optional parameter ladderName.  If a ladderName is 
     * provided, then it checks to see if the player has the permission: ranks.rankup.[ladderName].
     * 
     * Because these permissions are not ever used to check for actual permissions, it is very
     * important to provide parameters such as [ladderName] to signify where the server owner, or
     * admin, must place the real ladder name within the permission.
     * 
     * This is such a critically helpful feature because otherwise the only way you would know 
     * that you need this permission is to look at the source code, of which many cannot do, and 
     * those who can, may not know where to look.  So this provides very important information that
     * was not available before.
